2. **Improved Sleep Quality:**  Some research indicates that Ashwagandha may promote better sleep quality, particularly in individuals struggling with insomnia related to stress. 
3. **Enhanced Cognitive Function:**  Preliminary studies suggest Ashwagandha may have a positive impact on memory, attention, and information processing speed. 
4. **Increased Muscle Mass and Strength:**  Ashwagandha is sometimes used to support muscle growth and strength, potentially by increasing testosterone levels and reducing inflammation. 
5. **Boosting the Immune System:**  There is some evidence that Ashwagandha may possess immune-boosting properties, potentially by increasing the activity of certain immune cells. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before taking Ashwagandha, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have pre-existing medical conditions, or are taking other medications.  Ashwagandha can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for everyone.
